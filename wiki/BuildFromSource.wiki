=Building from source=
If you want to build the latest version instead of using the binary release, make sure your system has the following prerequisites:

 * Installed Qt SDK (>= 4.x)
 * Installed MinGW Compiler (should compile with MSVC too, but i haven't tested this)

Now fetch the source:
{{{
svn checkout http://nxtdebugmonitor.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ nxtdebugmonitor-read-only
}}}

create the Makefiles for your system (do this in the source directory):
{{{
qmake
}}}

now build the project (use the makefile for either a debugging or release build)
{{{
mingw32-make -f Makefile.Debug
}}}

when the build process if finished your should have a executable in debug/
If you want additional debugging messages, change the project type to "console" instead of "windows" in the DebugMonitor`.`pro file, run qmake and rebuild.
